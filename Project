# Remote Monitor and Control
**One of the users' satellite station was built on the top of a mountain. Every time I tried to enable the TX power or modified
some parameters, I had to go to that city, usually by train, and climb up to the top of the mountain. So, I come up with this 
little project so that I don't have to go there do anything. The only thing I need to do now is to find a computer with a 
internet connection any where in the world.**
